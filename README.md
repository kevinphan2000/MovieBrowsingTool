Here is some Guideline how to install and run this app:

See the Final Product in Final Produt File inside the Movie-App. There are 2 pictures shown Final App.

I use the VUE package framework in this Project. It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js when you install it on your system. By using command:
-- yarn install

You can serve a static site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network). It also provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents. Important, you can run this app, by using command:
-- yarn serve

Besides that you can BUILD and BUNDLE your local workspaces.
It's like Bazel, Buck and Pants but for Yarn.

-- yarn build
